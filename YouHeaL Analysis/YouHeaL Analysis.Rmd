#Timeline{.tabset}

The image shows the expected timeline of the [YouHeaL study](https://www.youhealprogram.com/). The study is designed to have 3 cohorts that each begin one year apart.  

During the first 6 months the first cohort is trained as Community Health Promoters (CHP) and completes a service project. The second 6 months, they are trained as Peer Health Mentors (PHM), where they learn to train their classmates to be CHPs. During the third 6 month period, Cohort 1 become PHMs that train Cohort 2 to be CHPs. At this point Cohort 2 begins doing everything Cohort 1 started, but 1 year behind them. During the fourth 6 month period, Cohort 1 is trained as Peer Health Leaders (PHL), where they learn to train the CHPs to become PHMs for Cohort 3, and then PHLs from Cohort 1 actually train Cohort 2 to be PHMs. Finally, during the fifth 6 month period, the PHLs from Cohort 1 work with the PHMs from Cohort 2 to train Cohort 3 to be CHPs.  

Each cohort is larger than the last, propagating healthy lifestyle habits to increasingly larger groups of high school students through their social networks.

#Data Management{.tabset}

The following steps are documented to explain how the data has been cleaned before the analysis. It is not important for most people to understand this, but it is written here to explain the data management process to future analysts.

##Variable Naming Convention

During the previous analysis, each variable was scored as baseline for Phase 1, and follow-up for Phase 2.1. From here on, Google Forms will be used to collect data in a standardized way. Variables are named by the following conventions.  

yh_cohort#_datatype_phase#, where:  

"cohort#" is cohort1, cohort2, or cohort3

"datatype" is sociodem, anthro, YRBS, efficacy, or empower  

"phase#" is phase1, phase2.1, phase2.2, phase3.1, or phase 3.2

##Data Paths

This chunk loads data for all the subsequent data collections. This data was collected using the google form.  

Note, for cohort 1, phase 1 and phase 2.1 were manually input into excel. A previous program formatted this data and saved it as an R dataset.  

Starting with cohort 1, phase 2.2, as well as for all subsequent cohorts, data was entered using a google form, allowing a uniform formatting using functions in this program. All data imports starting with cohort 1, phase 2.2 should have the same process for loading data.

```{r data_paths, echo = FALSE}

# cohort 1
data.path.c1 <- "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/20180823 YouHeal/Data/Cohort 1"
# cohort 1: phase 1, phase 2.1, phase 2.2
data.path.c1.p1p2 <- "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/20180823 YouHeal/Data/!Clean Datasets"
# cohort 1, phase 2.2
data.path.c1.p2.2 <- "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/20180823 YouHeal/Data/Cohort 1/Phase 2.2"
# cohort 1, phase 3.1
data.path.c1.p3.1 <- "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/20180823 YouHeal/Data/Cohort 1/Phase 3.1"

# cohort 2
data.path.c2 <- "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/20180823 YouHeal/Data/Cohort 2"
data.path.c2.p1 <- "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/20180823 YouHeal/Data/Cohort 2/Phase 1"
# cohort 2, phase 2.1
data.path.c2.p2.1 <- "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/20180823 YouHeal/Data/Cohort 2/Phase 2.1"

#cohort 3
```

##Load Data from Cohorts and Phases

This chunk loads data for Cohort 1 for Phases 1 and 2.1. This data was from the previously cleaned data in the previous analysis.

```{r loadP1P2.1Data, echo = FALSE}

#set directory to "Data" folder where .CSV files are located
setwd(data.path.c1.p1p2)

#import phase 1 and phase 2.1 data
load(file = "Phase1_Scored.RData")
```


###Cohort 1 (C1)

Cohort 1, Phase 1 and Phase 2.1 were cleaned using previous code, and saved as a single dataset. This section takes this dataset and tidies it so it will match subsequent data collections, which will be collected using a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYYCT2T8FhgbfYV5c6LHLVtrtcxSaBXMpgN363Atb-9C3Vdw/viewform). All subsequent data will be in the same format. The functions built below will automatically import the datasets, and make tidying the data much more efficient for analyses of data collected during future phases.

##Format Factors

This section formats categorical variables (i.e. factors) so they can be plotted and scored in a consistent fashion.

###List of Survey Item Responses to Format Factors  

This list contains all possible responses for all items in the YouHeaL survey. These are based off the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYYCT2T8FhgbfYV5c6LHLVtrtcxSaBXMpgN363Atb-9C3Vdw/viewform) that is available for future phases of the study. This way all responses can be scored automatically, without having to recode factor levels each time. A later chunk will make a function to format the Google Form item response factors.  

This list also contains old levels, from the manually entered data for Phases 1 and 2.1. This is used in the following chunk to reformat old responses to the updated format.  

```{r itemFactorList, echo = FALSE}
# make list of vectors of the properly (and old) formatted YRBS response levels
survey_fct_levels <- list(

This chunk applies the formatting and labeling functions to the Cohort 1, Phase 2.2 and Cohort 2, Phase 1 datasets. This is the first dataset to use the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYYCT2T8FhgbfYV5c6LHLVtrtcxSaBXMpgN363Atb-9C3Vdw/viewform).  

```{r formatGoogleForm_apply, echo = FALSE}
# format the YouHeaL surveys so factors match

# Cohort 1

    # Cohort 1, Phase 2.2
    yh_cohort1_phase2.2_labeled <- yh_cohort1_phase2.2 %>%
    # had to use manually entered sociodem formatting because copied variables from Phase 1
    format_GoogleForms_old()

    # Cohort 1, Phase 3.1
    yh_cohort1_phase3.1_labeled <- yh_cohort1_phase3.1 %>%
    # had to use manually entered sociodem formatting because copied variables from Phase 1
    format_GoogleForms_old()

# Cohort 2

  # Cohort 2, Phase 1
  yh_cohort2_phase1_labeled <- yh_cohort2_phase1 %>% format_GoogleForms()
  
  # Cohort 2, Phase 2.1
  yh_cohort2_phase2.1_labeled <- yh_cohort2_phase2.1 %>% format_GoogleForms()
```


##Merge Cohort and Phase Data  

This chunk combines all the different Cohorts and Phases into a single dataset

```{r mergeAll, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
analytic_cohort_raw <- 
  
  # cohort 1
  yh_cohort1_p1_p2.1_labeled %>% 
  bind_rows(yh_cohort1_phase2.2_labeled) %>% 
  bind_rows(yh_cohort1_phase3.1_labeled) %>% 
  
  # cohort 2
  bind_rows(yh_cohort2_phase1_labeled) %>% 
  bind_rows(yh_cohort2_phase2.1_labeled)
```


##Derived Variables  

Some variables need to be derived from the data. The following chunks create those variables.  


###Derived Sociodemographic Variables  

Derived sociodemographic variables include:  

* Living in Los Angeles (city_LA)
* Race Hispanic/Latino (race_HL)
* Race African American or Black (race_AAB)
* Race Asian (race_asian)
* Race White only (race_wo)

```{r deriveSD, echo = FALSE}
analytic_cohort <- analytic_cohort_raw %>% 
  mutate(
    
    # Indicator variable for Los Angeles residence (necessary because some entered "LA" and some entered "Los Angeles")
    city_LA = ifelse(
      str_detect(string = city, pattern = "LA") | str_detect(string = city, pattern = "Los Angeles"), 
      yes = 1, 
      no = 0
      ),
    city_LA = factor(city_LA, levels = c(1, 0), labels = c("Los Angeles", "Other"), ordered = TRUE),
    
    # Indicator variable for race: Hispanic/Latino
    race_HL = ifelse(
      str_detect(string = race, pattern = "Hispanic") | str_detect(string = race, pattern = "Latino") | str_detect(string = race, pattern = "Mexican"),
      yes = 1,
      no = 0
      ),
    race_HL = factor(race_HL, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Not Hispanic/Latino", "Hispanic/Latino"), ordered = TRUE),
    
    # Indicator variable for race: African American or Black
    race_AAB = ifelse(
      str_detect(string = race, pattern = "African American") | str_detect(string = race, pattern = "Black"),
      yes = 1,
      no = 0
      ),
    race_AAB = factor(race_AAB, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Not African American or Black", "African American or Black"), ordered = TRUE),

    # Indicator variable for race: Asian
    race_asian = ifelse(
      str_detect(string = race, pattern = "Asian"),
      yes = 1,
      no = 0
      ),
    race_asian = factor(race_asian, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Not Asian", "Asian"), ordered = TRUE),

    # Indicator variable for race: White only
    race_wo = ifelse(
      str_detect(string = race, pattern = "white") & race_HL == 0 & race_AAB == 0 & race_asian == 0,
      yes = 1,
      no = 0
      ),
    race_wo = factor(race_wo, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Not White Only", "White Only"), ordered = TRUE)    
    )
```


###Derived YRBS Diet Items  

Scoring the [Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/data.htm) Diet Items - Items Q7 to Q17  

Q18 asks about allergies, and was removed from analyses per discussion with Kasra.  

Each item asks about frequency of consuming various foods and beverages. 

This scoring method assumes the following items are "healthy", and the more often an individual consumes them, the better:  

* Q8 Fruit  
* Q9 Salad  
* Q10 Potato  
* Q11 Carrots  
* Q12 Other Vegetable  
* Q15 Water  
* Q16 Milk  
* Q17 Breakfast  

This method also assumes the following items are "unhealthy", and the less often an individual consumes them, the better:  

* Q7 Juice  
* Q13 Soda  
* Q14 Sports Drink  

The "unhealthy" items are reversed in order, so the greater the number the less often they are consumed.  

Each item response is then converted to an integer value, and all points are sumed for each individual to provide an overall diet score.  

This is a crude method because items Q7 to Q16 have 7 possible item responses, so possible points are 1 to 7. But Q17 (breakfast) has 8 possible items, so possible points are 1 to 8. This means the breakfast question is weighted slightly greater than the other diet items.  

Possible ways to redress this are to:  

* standardize all items to a 0 to 100 points scale
* use item response theory and confirmatory factor analysis to be sure we are measuring a single construct
* only compare items at the individual question level to [CDC data for Los Angeles](https://nccd.cdc.gov/Youthonline/App/Results.aspx?LID=CA)  

```{r derivDiet, echo = FALSE}
analytic_cohort$YRBS_diet_total <- analytic_cohort %>% select(
  Q7_YRBS_juice, Q8_YRBS_fruit, Q9_YRBS_salad, Q10_YRBS_potato, Q11_YRBS_carrot, Q12_YRBS_otherveg, Q13_YRBS_soda, Q14_YRBS_sportdrink, Q15_YRBS_water, Q16_YRBS_milk, Q17_YRBS_breakfast) %>% 
  
  # Convert factor levels to integer values
  mutate(
    
    ## Healthy items
    Q8_YRBS_fruit = Q8_YRBS_fruit %>% as.integer,
    Q9_YRBS_salad = Q9_YRBS_salad %>% as.integer,
    Q10_YRBS_potato = Q10_YRBS_potato %>% as.integer,
    Q11_YRBS_carrot = Q11_YRBS_carrot %>% as.integer,
    Q12_YRBS_otherveg = Q12_YRBS_otherveg %>% as.integer,
    Q15_YRBS_water = Q15_YRBS_water %>% as.integer,
    Q16_YRBS_milk = Q16_YRBS_milk %>% as.integer,
    Q17_YRBS_breakfast = Q17_YRBS_breakfast %>% as.integer,

    ## Unhealthy items, factor orders are reversed
    Q7_YRBS_juice = Q7_YRBS_juice %>% fct_rev %>% as.integer,
    Q13_YRBS_soda = Q13_YRBS_soda %>% fct_rev %>% as.integer,
    Q14_YRBS_sportdrink = Q14_YRBS_sportdrink %>% fct_rev %>% as.integer
    
  ) %>% 
  
  # sum the rows to get the overall YRBS diet composite
  apply(MARGIN = 1, FUN = sum, na.rm = FALSE) 

print("Summary stats for YRBS Diet score")
analytic_cohort$YRBS_diet_total %>% summary

test <- analytic_cohort %>% select(ID, cohort, phase, YRBS_diet_total,
  Q7_YRBS_juice, Q8_YRBS_fruit, Q9_YRBS_salad, Q10_YRBS_potato, Q11_YRBS_carrot, Q12_YRBS_otherveg, Q13_YRBS_soda, Q14_YRBS_sportdrink, Q15_YRBS_water, Q16_YRBS_milk, Q17_YRBS_breakfast)
```


###Derived YRBS Physical Items  

Scoring the [Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/data.htm) Diet Items - Items Q19 to Q22  

Q23, Q24, and Q25 asks about physical education, sports teams, and concussions, respectively. These items were from analyses per discussion with Kasra.  

Each item asks about frequency of performing physical activity or sedentary behaviors.  

This scoring method assumes the following items are "healthy", and the more often an individual does them, the better:  

* Q19 Physical Activity  
* Q20 Strength Training  

This method also assumes the following items are "unhealthy", and the less often an individual does them, the better:  

* Q21 Television  
* Q22 Screen Time

The YRBS physical activity composite is scored the sam was as the YRBS diet composite (explained above). In short, the "healthy" items are assigned integer values, the "unhealthy" items are reversed in order and assigned integer values, and then a sum is taken of all item scores to produce a composite physical score.  

The same issues with scoring the YRBS diet composite exist for the YRBS physical activity composite (see above).

```{r derivPhys, echo = FALSE}
analytic_cohort$YRBS_physical_total <- analytic_cohort %>% 
  select(Q19_YRBS_physical, Q20_YRBS_strength, Q21_YRBS_tv, Q22_YRBS_screentime) %>% 
  
  # Convert factor levels to integer values
  mutate(
    
    ## Healthy items
    Q19_YRBS_physical = Q19_YRBS_physical %>% as.integer,
    Q20_YRBS_strength = Q20_YRBS_strength %>% as.integer,

    ## Unhealthy items, factor orders are reversed
    Q21_YRBS_tv = Q21_YRBS_tv %>% fct_rev %>% as.integer,
    Q22_YRBS_screentime = Q22_YRBS_screentime %>% fct_rev %>% as.integer

  ) %>% 
  
  # sum the rows to get the overall YRBS diet composite
  apply(MARGIN = 1, FUN = sum, na.rm = FALSE)

print("Summary stats for YRBS Physical Activity score")
analytic_cohort$YRBS_physical_total %>% summary
```


###Derived Self-Efficacy Scores  

This chunk scores the General Self-Efficacy (GSE) survey.  

The total score is calculated by finding the sum of the all items. For the GSE, the total score ranges between 10 and 40, with a higher score indicating more self-efficacy.

These are the weights for each possible item response:  

* 1 - Not at all true  
* 2 - Hardly true  
* 3 - Moderately true  
* 4 - Exactly true  

```{r deriveGSE, echo = FALSE}
# look at items from GSE survey
# analytic_cohort %>% select(ends_with("efficacy")) %>% glimpse

# function that replaces factor responses with integer weight values
scoreGSE <- function(x){
  ifelse(
    x == "Not at all true", yes = 1, no = ifelse(
      x == "Hardly true", yes = 2, no = ifelse(
        x == "Moderately true", yes = 3, no = ifelse(
          x == "Exactly true", yes = 4, no = NA
        )
      )
    )
  )
}

# make a variable of the total efficacy score (from 10 to 40) 
analytic_cohort$total_efficacy <- analytic_cohort %>% 
  select(ends_with("efficacy")) %>% 
  # add points to each response for GSE items
  apply(MARGIN = 2, FUN = scoreGSE) %>%
  # sum the points for each individual during each Phase to get a total score
  apply(MARGIN = 1, FUN = sum, na.rm = FALSE)

print("Summary stats for Total Self-Efficacy score")
analytic_cohort$total_efficacy %>% summary
```


###Derived Empowerment Scores  

This chunk scores the [Empowerment (Emp) Survey](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/51261/495.pdf?sequence=1).  

These are the weights for each possible item response:  

* 1 - Disagree strongly 
* 2 - Disagree somewhat  
* 3 - Agree somewhat   
* 4 - Agree strongly     
   
Four different scores are generated for Empowerment by taking the sum of specific items:  

Composite Empowerment (EmpCmp), sum items 36 to 47 (all 12 items)  

Individual Empowerment (EmpInd), sum items 41 and 43 (2 items)  

Community Empowerment (EmpCmn), sum item 42 and items 44 to 47 (5 items)  

Organizational Empowerment (EmpOrg), sum items 36 to 40 (5 items)  

```{r deriveEmp, echo = FALSE}
# look at items from Emp survey
# analytic_cohort %>% select(ends_with("empower")) %>% glimpse

# function that replaces factor responses with integer weight values
weightEmp <- function(x){
  ifelse(
    x == "Disagree strongly", yes = 1, no = ifelse(
      x == "Disagree somewhat", yes = 2, no = ifelse(
        x == "Agree somewhat", yes = 3, no = ifelse(
          x == "Agree strongly", yes = 4, no = NA
        )
      )
    )
  )
}

# function that produces each empowerment score depending on which items are included
scoreEmp <- function(item_string){
  analytic_cohort %>% 
    select(item_string) %>% 
    # add points to each response for EmpCmp items
    apply(MARGIN = 2, FUN = weightEmp) %>%
    # sum the points for each individual during each Phase to get a total score
    apply(MARGIN = 1, FUN = sum, na.rm = FALSE)
}

# creates Composite Empowerment variable (range from 12 to 48, all empowerment items - Q36 to Q47) 
analytic_cohort$empower_composite <- scoreEmp(c("Q36_empower", "Q37_empower", "Q38_empower", "Q39_empower", "Q40_empower", "Q41_empower", "Q42_empower", "Q43_empower", "Q44_empower", "Q45_empower", "Q46_empower", "Q47_empower"))

print("Summary stats for Organizational Empowerment score")

```


###Derived Anthropometric Variables  

Cutoffs for obesity are defined by the CDC as greater than or equal to the 85th percentile for measurements of both triceps skinfold (TSF) and waist curcumference (WC):  

[Anthropometric Reference Data for Children and Adults: United States, 2007–2010](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_11/sr11_252.pdf)  

The following are obesity cutoffs in adolescents for anthropometric variables by sex and age:  

```{r obeseCut, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

##Save Phase 1 Dataset

This chunk saves the dataset as a permanent R datafile. This can be used for further analysis, without having to clean the data again.

```{r saveData, echo = FALSE}
#set save location
setwd(data.path.c1.p1p2)

# Save phase 1 data file
# save(analytic_cohort, file = "YouHeaL_analytic_cohort.RData")
```


#Baseline Sociodemographics{.tabset}

Table 1 shows sociodemographic variables, including age, sex, residence, race, and languages spoken. Table 1a shows these sociodemographics for each cohort at baseline. This is the most telling table, and should be used for future publications.

Tables 1b, 1c, and 1d show these variables seperately for each cohort across all phases. Normally these tables would not be shown, but given the design of this study, it is useful to see if demographics are changing across the phases as participants are lost to follow-up. It might reveal that a certain demographic is dropping out of the study.

##Table 1a: Baseline (Phase 1) Sociodemographics

This table shows the sociodemographic characteristics of each cohort when they enter the study during Phase 1. This is the most telling table, and should be used for future publications.  

```{r table1a, echo=FALSE}
# vector of variables to be included in Table 1
table1_vars <- c("age", "sex", "city_LA", "race_HL", "race_AAB", "race_asian", "race_wo", "language1", "english_prof")

# vector of categorical variables in analytic dataset
table1_categorical <- c("cohort", "phase", "sex", "race_HL", "race_AAB", "race_asian", "race_wo", "language1", "english_prof")

# select sociodemographic variables for table1
table1a_data <- analytic_cohort %>% 
  filter(phase == "Phase 1") %>% 
  # force age to be a double, not a factor
  mutate(age = as.double(age))

table1a <- CreateTableOne(data = table1a_data, strata = "cohort", vars = table1_vars, factorVars = table1_categorical, test = FALSE, includeNA = TRUE)

## export table 1 to html
table1a_html <- print(table1a, quote = FALSE, noSpaces = F, printToggle = F, varLabels = T)
table1a_html %>% kableone(digits = 3) %>%
  kable_styling(
    #bootstrap table classes
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")
  ) %>% 
  pack_rows("Residence", 4, 7) %>% 
  pack_rows("Race", 8, 11) 
  # pack_rows("Language", 12, 16)
```


##Table 1b: Cohort 1 Sociodemographics

This plot shows the sociodemographic characteristics of Cohort 1 at each phase. This may be useful to see if a certain demographic is staying in the study relative to those who drop out. This table should not be used in publications, but is more of a check to be considered internally within the YouHeaL group as the study progresses.  

Note, statistical comparisons are underpowered for Cohort 1, and should be considered unreliable. Also note, there are some variables (race, residence) where there are no differences across phases. Therefore, statistical tests are not possible.

```{r table1b, echo = FALSE}

# function that will compare sociodems across phases for each cohort
table1_phase <- function(cohort_num){
  
  # vector of variables to be included in Table 1
  table1_vars <- c("age", "sex", "city_LA", "race_HL", "race_AAB", "race_asian", "race_wo", "language1", "english_prof")
  
  # vector of categorical variables in analytic dataset
  table1_categorical <- c("cohort", "phase", "city_LA", "sex", "race_HL", "race_AAB", "race_asian", "race_wo", "language1", "english_prof")

  # select sociodemographic variables for table1
  table1_data <- analytic_cohort %>% 
    filter(cohort == cohort_num) %>% 
    mutate(age = as.double(age))
  
  table1 <- CreateTableOne(data = table1_data, strata = "phase", vars = table1_vars, factorVars = table1_categorical, test = TRUE, includeNA = TRUE)
  
  ## export table 1 to html
  table1_html <- print(table1, quote = FALSE, noSpaces = F, printToggle = F, varLabels = T)
  table1_html %>% kableone(digits = 3) %>%
    kable_styling(
      #bootstrap table classes
      bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")
    ) %>%
    pack_rows("Residence", 4, 4) %>% 
    pack_rows("Race", 5, 8) %>% 
    pack_rows("Language", 9, 10)
}

# call function for Cohort 1
table1_phase(cohort_num = "Cohort 1")
```


##Table 1c: Cohort 2 Sociodemographics

This plot shows the sociodemographic characteristics of Cohort 2 at each phase. This may be useful to see if a certain demographic is staying in the study relative to those who drop out. This table should not be used in publications, but is more of a check to be considered internally within the YouHeaL group as the study progresses.  

Note, this table cannot be created until subsequent phases occur for Cohort 2. There are only data for baseline (Phase 1). But this will be useful once future phases are completed.

```{r table1c, echo = FALSE}
# call function for Cohort 2
table1_phase(cohort_num = "Cohort 2")
```


##Table 1d: Cohort 3 Sociodemographics

This plot shows the sociodemographic characteristics of Cohort 3 at each phase. This may be useful to see if a certain demographic is staying in the study relative to those who drop out. This table should not be used in publications, but is more of a check to be considered internally within the YouHeaL group as the study progresses.  

Note, this table cannot be created until subsequent phases occur for Cohort 3. No data has been collected for Cohort 3 yet. But this will be useful once multiple phases are completed for this cohort.

```{r table1d, echo = FALSE}
# call function for Cohort 3
# table1_phase(cohort_num = "Cohort 3")
```


#Baseline Exploratory Data Analysis

This analysis attempts to answer the question: "How do the cohorts differ at baseline (Phase 1)?" This question applies to YRBS diet and physical activity scores, self-efficacy, empowerment, and anthropometric measurements.

##Violin Plots

The function below creates [violin plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot) of each variable at baseline by cohort. Violin plots show all the same information as boxplots, but in addition they show the distributions, similar to a histogram.  

##Boxplots

Boxplots are overlain on the violin plots. These are Tukey "box and whiskers" plots, where the top and bottom of the box represent the first and third quartiles (i.e. 25th and 75th percentiles), and the middle bar is the median (i.e. 50th percentile). The bottom "whisker" represents the smallest data point that is no more than 1.5 times the inter-quartile range (the distance from the first to third quartiles) below the first quartile. The top "whisker" represents the largest data point that is no more than 1.5 times the inter-quartile range above the third quartile. Points smaller or greater than these whiskers, respectively, are considered outliers and plotted individually.

```{r violin_fun, echo = FALSE}
# make a violin plot showing the distribution of YRBS Diet scores in the entire YouHeaL dataset
violin_baseline <- function(var){
  
  # select only baseline measurements (Phase 1)
  df <- analytic_cohort %>%
    # remove missing variable
    filter(!is.na(var)) %>% 
    # restrict to baseline, Phase 1 measurements
    filter(phase == "Phase 1")
  
  # convert outcome to continuous variable
  df$var_formatted <- as.double(df[[var]])
  
  # violin plot with boxplots overlain
  df %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = var_formatted, x = cohort, color = cohort)) +
    geom_violin(na.rm = TRUE) +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE) +
    # add theme colors (set in first chunk)
    yh_cohort_colors() +
    # remove legend
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    scale_x_discrete(limits = rev(levels(df$cohort))) +
    coord_flip() +
    # keep variable label as Y-axis
    ylab(paste0(label(df[[var]]), " at Baseline (Phase 1)")) +
    xlab("")
}
```


##Overall Violin Plot Interpretation{.tabset}

For all variables, it appears that the participants in Cohort 1 were more similar to each other (i.e. had a smaller standard deviation) than participants in Cohort 2. This makes sense, as those who joined Cohort 1 were likely more homogeneous with greater motivation, healthier habits, and greater senses of self-efficacy and empowerment, compared to those who joined later. However, Cohort 1 may also be more similar because this cohort had about one third as many participants as the second cohort.


###YRBS

####YRBS Diet

The median diet score is slightly greater for Cohort 1, but the distribution in scores is much smaller. Note the positive outlier in Cohort 2. This suggests Cohort 1 had more similar diet scores overall and were somewhat healther than Cohort 2.

```{r violin_diet, echo = FALSE}
violin_baseline(var = "YRBS_diet_total")
```


####YRBS Physical Activity

Cohort 2 had a greater median physical activity score, and again had a larger spread (standard deviation) than Cohort 1. This suggests Cohort 2 is somewhat more active than Cohort 1.

```{r violin_phys, echo = FALSE}
violin_baseline(var = "YRBS_physical_total")
```


###Self-Efficacy

Cohort 1 had a greater median self-efficacy score. Cohort 1 also had a much tighter distribution (smaller standard deviation) than Cohort 2. Note the positive and negative outliers in Cohort 2.

```{r violin_GSE, echo = FALSE}
violin_baseline(var = "total_efficacy")
```


###Empowerment

####Composite Empowerment

Cohort 1 had a slightly greater median composite empowerment score than Cohort 2, and much less spread (smaller standard deviation). 

```{r violin_EmpCmp, echo = FALSE}
violin_baseline(var = "empower_composite")
```


####Individual Empowerment

Cohort 1 had a greater median individual empowerment score than Cohort 2. The standard deviation was greater for Cohort 2.

Note the median (50th percentile) and the first quartile (25th percentile) are overlapping for both cohorts. This is likely because the individual empowerment score is based on only 2 items, and therefore has much less possible variation. This increases the odds of individuals having the same scores, causing data sparsity issues, and making it impossible to make full boxplots without having more participants in each cohort. 

```{r violin_EmpInd, echo = FALSE}
violin_baseline(var = "empower_individual")
```


####Community Empowerment

Cohort 1 had a greater community empowerment score, but only slightly. Cohort 2 had slightly greater spread (standard deviation).

```{r violin_EmpCmn, echo = FALSE}
violin_baseline(var = "empower_community")
```


####Organizational Empowerment

The cohorts had similar median scores for organizational empowerment. Cohort 2 was negatively skewed by an outlier. Note, the maximum possible score is 20 points for organizational empowerment; both cohorts are maxed out, suggesting a ceiling effect for this composite score. This suggests most participants have a high sense of empowerment in their organization (school).

```{r violin_EmpOrg, echo = FALSE}
violin_baseline(var = "empower_organization")
```


###Anthropometric Measurements

####Triceps Skinfold

The median triceps skinfold measurement was greater for Cohort 2. There were some positive outliers in this second cohort with much larger triceps skinfold measurements.  

Note, these measurements are conditional on age (see table in section "Derived Anthropometric Variables"). However, the average age at Phase 1 were similar: 15.69 (0.48) for Cohort 1, and 15.30 (0.97) for Cohort 2 (see Table 1a). This suggests direct comparisons of anthropometric variables betweeen Cohorts 1 and 2 are reasonable, and Cohort 2 truly has greater triceps skinfold than Cohort 1, independent of normal growth in teenagers.

```{r violin_TSF, echo = FALSE}
violin_baseline(var = "TSF_avg")
```


####Waist Circumference

The median waist circumference was greater for Cohort 2. There were also several outliers with relatively large waist circumference measurements.

```{r violin_WC, echo = FALSE}
violin_baseline(var = "WC_avg")
```


#Visualizing Raw Trajectories{.tabset}

###Spaghetti Plots

[Spaghetti plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_plot) can model longitudinal data over time. Each line represents an individual in the study. The line connects variable scores (YRBS Diet, Self-Efficacy, Triceps Skinfold, etc.) at each phase of the study. The thicker, red line represents the average score of all participants.  

Note, some lines do not continue through all phases, indicating an individual who dropped out.

Individuals have been stratified by sex to explore changes in variable scores over time for male and female sex.

#Restrict to Complete Data

```{r, include=FALSE}

# This is a preliminary analysis done for data collection through summer 2019, which corresponded to Phase 3.1 for Cohort 1, and Phase 2.1 for Cohort 2. Exclusion criteria will be different in the final analysis. For now, restrict to those who have not missed a single data measurement phase.
# 
# The final dataset should include all participants who completed 3 measurements, i.e. up to Phase 2.1; this is because longitudinal data is defined as 3 or more measurements on the same individual (unit).
# 
# By this logic, the paper should be ready to be published January 2021, once 3 measurements are available for Cohort 3.

# **Age** was the only statisitcally significant difference among those who participated in and those who dropped out of YouHeaL: participants were 7 months younger on average (p = 0.02). This suggest that older high-school students are more likely to abandon YouHeaL.    
# 
# There were many non-significant differences (p > 0.05) that may be of interest. Participants were more likely to be **female** (76% vs 55%, p = 0.19) and to **speak Spanish at home** (77% vs 60%, p = 0.35). Participants were more likely to be **overweight** (anthropometric measurements greater than the 85th percentile for age and sex adjusted strata): **triceps skin fold** (43% vs 30%, p = 0.513) and **waist circumference** (23% vs 5%, p = 0.18). These differences may be significant when more students enroll in subsequent cohorts and phases.

This is a preliminary analysis done for up to **Phase 2.1** for both **Cohort 1** and **Cohort 2**. Exclusion criteria will be different in the final analysis.

The final dataset will include all participants who completed 3 measurements, i.e. up to Phase 2.2; this is because longitudinal data is defined as 3 or more measurements on the same individual (unit).

By this logic, the paper should be ready to be published January 2021, once 3 measurements are available for Cohort 3.

Note, we did not include Cohort 1 past phase 2.1—even though we have data from later phases for Cohort 1—because there is low power when looking at this cohort alone. Eventually we will include all data from all participants with at least 3 completed phases, but for now, this is the best way to balance power with longitudinal
